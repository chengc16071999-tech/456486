	abstract = {This article delves into the collaborative intelligence efforts between Kuomintang ({KMT}) agents and the British Special Operations Executive ({SOE}) during the Pacific War. Broadly, preceding the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific, the British lack of preparedness for a potential Japanese incursion into Singapore-Malaya resulted in inadequate local readiness by the {SOE}. On December 8, 1941, with the onset of the Pacific War, tensions escalated due to the clandestine nature of {KMT}'s intelligence apparatus in Singapore-Malaya and the rapid collapse of British defence. Consequently, the {SOE} opted to align with the Malayan Communist Party. Following the total capitulation of Singapore-Malaya on February 15, 1942, retreating {SOE} personnel initiated the Indian Mission upon reaching India, establishing contact with {KMT} through figures like Lim Bo Seng and fostering a collaborative partnership. Subsequently, individuals handpicked by the {KMT} underwent rigorous training in India. Despite concerted efforts, {KMT} agents successfully infiltrating Malaya via submarines managed to establish an operational intelligence network. Nonetheless, the relentless pursuit by the Japanese Kempeitai led to the dismantling of this network, resulting in the apprehension of key figures such as Lim Bo Seng. Overall, {KMT} agents made a notable contribution to the {SOE}'s intelligence endeavours in Malaya during the Pacific War, thereby playing a significant role in the eventual Allied victory.},
